models:
  - name: dim_customer
    description: >
      This model creates the `dim_customer` table by integrating data from `Store`, 
      `Person`, and `Customer`. It prioritizes the `Store` 
      when available; otherwise, it uses the full name of the associated person.
      The model ensures a clean and consolidated view of customers for analytical purposes.

    columns:
      - name: pk_customer
        description: Primary key that uniquely identifies each customer.

      - name: name_customer
        description: >
          The name of the customer, derived either from the store name (`store.name_store`)
          or, if unavailable, from the concatenation of the person's first, middle (if present),
          and last name.
